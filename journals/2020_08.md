### I really want to get the CrashBoards International start up pitch speech. That is on my mind. Moreover, I want this day ti to be something that I keep for 'housekeeping'. lol. There are several times that I think why #logseq is something that I gravitate towards very closely.
### I like the way how I just changed the topic. I am a master at this
### There is a perticular incidence that I want to reveal. This event made my heart feel #warm from the inside.
#### This event includes Riddhi. I am not sure if I am spelling out her name right, but what a hero!
#### So on [[Jul 30th, 2020]] I was in the lab alone. It had been the best part of 30 minutes. Just then there was a knock on the glass window. I saw Riddhi, and then with questionable eyes, she gave me a thumbs up.
#### Absolutely pleased, I left my work then and there, and I opened the now locked door, went out and asked her how she is.
#### I have been willing to message her "Hey dude, your warm action really warmed up my heart! Thank you!"
### What a LOL, I read 110 pages of [[Book - Rich Dad Poor Dad]] today, and what a riveting read! I am literally $$\frac{1}{4}$$th of the way there and I could not be more excited!

##### Good Morning Ma'am. For my Biology IA, I was in need of YPD Broth which we have no stock of in school. Ma'am, would it possible for the school to purchase the broth?
##### Thank you ma'am!
##### RESPONSE: Wow! She gave a really prompt response. She said that the broth should be available by [[Aug 17th, 2020]].

## **Quote of the day**: "Action is not something that is sparked by motivation. Motivation is something sparked by action. Do the action, and motivation shall follow you on its own."

### I have woken up #fresh today. I think everyone wakes up fresh. But today has to be different. I have not worked for shit sake in the last two days. I need to get some work done. Though I have added stuff to the todo list and stuff, I am scared that the one break I take after Supriyo Uncle's class will be the break I never wanted.
### Never mid that. The action plan for today is to digest some of my NIBBLE's . The more I think of it, the more nessacary it becomes. Plus this is not something that is going to be taking ages, it will at max take one hour.
### One more thing that I realised while [[Jul 31st, 2020]] class with [[Latha Ma'am]] is that there is some fear. There is the fear of starting out. I do not have any other way. I must just do it. You need to remember: "Action is not something that is sparked by motivation. Motivation is something sparked by action. Do the action, and motivation shall follow you on its own."
### My [[Mom]] is certainly the best. I do not want to write down the incidence, because I do not want to remember it, but I want to know that it existed.

### There have been constant delays in the [[CrashBoards x Waxdale Pitch]]. Sometimes they are giving us excuses of "forgetting" followed by a very interesting "technical error", WOW! Give these guys a script, they are ment to be on stage.
### There were two funny incidence that happened because of this. One involves [[Mom]] and the other involves [[Adithya]].
### Mom said that "now you know how tough challenges come by". This statement was something that I realised that even [[Dad]] might be going through. Maybe the jab (x25) hook thing is not only applicable in the startup world but is something that is applicable to #life
