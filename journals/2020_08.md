### I really want to get the [[CrashBoards International]] speech. That is on my mind. Moreover, I want this day ti to be something that I keep for 'housekeeping'. lol. There are several times that I think why #logseq is something that I gravitate towards very closely.
### I like the way how I just changed the topic. I am a master at this
### There is a perticular incidence that I want to reveal. This event made my heart feel #warm from the inside.
#### This event includes Riddhi. I am not sure if I am spelling out her name right, but what a hero!
#### So on [[Jul 30th, 2020]] I was in the lab alone. It had been the best part of 30 minutes. Just then there was a knock on the glass window. I saw Riddhi, and then with questionable eyes, she gave me a thumbs up.
#### Absolutly pleased, I left my work then and there, and I opened the now locked door, went out and asked her how she is.
#### I have been willing to message her "Hey dude, your warm action really warmed up my heart! Thank you!"
