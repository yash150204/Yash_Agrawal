## **Surface** proteins on the virus that affect the human body
### 1. Spike protein
### 2. Hemoglutin esterase protein
#### Hemoglutin is also a surface protein on the influenza
### These two proteins are needed to express ACE 2 which infect cells.
### Other proteins (1) M and (2) E proteins
## Bi-layer envelope that covers the envelope
## Viral Nucleic acid: **Postive-sense Single Stranded RNA** abbreviated to +SSRNA
### This type is in addition to RNA, DNA and SSRNA
## The virus causes a [[cytokine storm]]

### Refer: [Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3294426/)
### Basically the immune system going rouge
### Not a deep understanding of the molecular occurrences or its contribution to pathogenesis
## The bat virus RaTG13 has 96.2% genetic similarity to SARS-COV $$_2$$
## Virus from bats -> intermidiate -> humans? The virus in the bat goes through something known as ^^homologous recommbination^^
### In the genetic material of the host, there is some swapping around of the genetic material
