## **Surface** proteins on the virus that affect the human body
### 1. Spike protein
### 2. Hemoglutin esterase protein
#### Hemoglutin is also a surface protein on the influenza
### These two proteins are needed to express ACE 2 which infect cells.
### Other proteins (1) M and (2) E proteins
## Bi-layer envelope that covers the envelope
## Viral Nucleic acid: **Postive-sense Single Stranded RNA** abbreviated to +SSRNA
## The virus causes a [[cytokine storm]]

### Refer: [Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3294426/)
### Basically the immune system going rouge
### Not a deep understanding of the molecular occurrences or its contribution to pathogenesis
## The bat virus RaTG13 has 96.2% genetic similarity to SARS-COV $$_2$$Virus from bats -> intermediate -> humans? The virus in the bat goes through something known as ^^homologous recommbination^^
## In the genetic material of the host, there is some swapping around of the genetic material
## There are two 'types' of SARS-COV $$_2$$
### 1. 'S' Type
#### Less common (30%), less severe and less aggressive
### 2. 'L' Type
#### More common (70%), more severe and more aggressive
#### The S type may have evolved to form the L type
## Case fatality rate = $$ \frac{fatality}{incidence}$$ currently this is 6.9%
## Rate of transmission is something that is determined by $$R_o$$ (reproductive ratio) and (2) $$S_I$$ (series interval - the time it takes for the infected individual to infect another person). Hence $R=R_o+S_I  $
### Series intervals is with terms of infected individuals
