## **Procedure Research** [LINK](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~nsw/ench485/lab3.htm)
### DONE Check availability of casein. **NOT AVAILABLE**
### TODO Make Procedure suitable to your experiment
### TODO Experiment - Effect of thyroxine on the rate of digestion
### TODO Experiment - The control experiment
### DONE Which enzyme?
### Make a 100g\L protein mixture by dissolving albumin in water
### Make a 50g/L saturated pepsin solution
#### Why not trypsin and not pepsin?
#### Pepsin is an enzyme that acts in the stomach, and is a stomach acid. Trypsin in a pancreatic enzyme that is secreted by the pancreases and is something that acts in the small intestine.
### Mix 50ml of albumin solution and 50ml of pepsin solution
n
### Add 10ml of 1 molar HCl#### The ratio is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BPEuLcR4_I) vid
### Add 25ml of 5% #TBD (seaweed) solution
#### 5g of seaweed powder will be added to 100ml of water to create a 5% seaweed solution
#### Add half the volume of 5% crushed seaweed solution.
##### DONE How will you be getting the seaweed?
###### Lazada + Local store
##### DONE Genus + Species?
###### Potential target: _Laminaria Digitata_ (kombu kelp) found on [Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/products/kombu-powder-i356266853-s831106321.html?exlaz=d_1:mm_150050845_51350205_2010350205::12:1025267241!54483208270!!!pla-297963845945!c!297963845945!831106321!138962662&gclid=CjwKCAjwsan5BRAOEiwALzomX0Cawyb0jV1lVOPRKdftoxPIUlBQB3d7HDq2ehAkxUtbyJCOzAu7YhoCNncQAvD_BwE)
### **Investigating the effect of thyroxine** -> Add 50ml of thyroxine solution
#### Thyroxine obtained from
#### Make a 150mcg/L solution of thyroxine solution (based on image in research paper)

### Note the time at the start of the hydrolysis reaction.
)
E)
### Withdraw 5 ml of the solution and measure the amino acid concentration of the solution as a function of time by using the ninhydrin colourimetric method.
#### 0.35g of Ninhydrin + 100ml ethanol in test-tube + parafilm to prevent evaporation of alcohol
#### **Chemical process**
###### 1. alpha-amino acid + ninhydrin -> reduced ninhydrin + alpha-amino acid + H2O
###### 2. alpha-amino acid + H2O -> alpha-keto acid + NH3
###### 3. alpha-keto acid + NH3 -> aldehyde + CO2
#### Suggested sampling time interval: ​10 minutes for at least one hour. Colour change: from yellow (colour of ninhydrin) to purple
#### **Wavelength**:​ 570nm
#### Physical process​: 1ml of ninhydrin solution in 5ml solution of a
#### Repeat the process for 15%, 25%, 35%, 50% seaweed solution

## **Control Variables**
### (1) No activator present
#### Activators are molecules that bind to enzymes and increase their activity. If activators were present, the effect of iodine cannot be tested in isolation
#### As the test was carried out _in-vitro_ no additional activators or inhibitors were added
### (2) Concentration of enzymes
#### To test the effect of iodine in isolation
#### A bulk solution of enzymes was created, from which the tests were carried out from
### (3) Concentration of albumin
#### To test the effect of iodine in isolation
#### A bulk solution of albumin was created, from which the tests were carried out from
### (4)  pH of reaction
#### Enzymes are pH sensitive, hence the pH needs to be maintained low.
#### 1ml 1 Molar HCl was added to the solution to maintain the pH at 1
### (5) Temperature at which the reaction is carried out
#### Enzymes are temperature sensitive, which enhances its performance
#### The reaction is conducted in a incubator at a temperature of 37ºC

## **DISCUSSION**
### Homeopathic doctors ask for supplementary intake of seaweed to supplement patients with iodine deficiency with iodine. I want to test the effect seaweed has on thyroxine in itself.
