## CHECKLIST
### TODO The multiple experiment stuff
### TODO Hypothesis
### DONE Check availability of casein. **NOT AVAILABLE**### TODO Make Procedure suitable to your experiment### TODO Experiment - Effect of thyroxine on the rate of digestion### TODO Experiment - The control experiment
### DONE Which enzyme?
## This procedure can be repeated for lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. I am not too sure about that though.
