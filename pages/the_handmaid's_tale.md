## Symbols
### **Rape and sexual violence**
#### I: Night - Narrator: Offred - "I remember that yearning, for something that was always about to happen and was never the same as the hands that were on us there and then, in the small of the back, or out back, in the parking lot, or in the television room with the sound turned down and only the pictures flickering over lifting flesh."
#### Description of sextual exploitation. These people are probably some type of sex workers or something. 
### **Religious terms and biblical allusions used for Political Purposes**
#### SparkNotes
##### Gilead is a theocracy—a government in which there is no separation between state and religion—and its official vocabulary incorporates religious terminology and biblical references. Domestic servants are called “Marthas” in reference to a domestic character in the New Testament; the local police are “Guardians of the Faith”; soldiers are “Angels”; and the Commanders are officially “Commanders of the Faithful.” All the stores have biblical names: Loaves and Fishes, All Flesh, Milk and Honey. Even the automobiles have biblical names like Behemoth, Whirlwind, and Chariot. Using religious terminology to describe people, ranks, and businesses whitewashes political skullduggery in pious language. It provides an ever-present reminder that the founders of Gilead insist they act on the authority of the Bible itself. Politics and religion sleep in the same bed in Gilead, where the slogan “God is a National Resource” predominates.
##### Martha
###### Martha translates to "the misteress" or "the lady".
###### Though she is venerated as a figure of maturity and strength, it is quite ironical that she is used to represent the domestic servants, who are, in a theocracy a symbol of weakness and lack any power what-so-ever.
#### I: Night - “specially picked from the Angels”.
#### Angles refer to soldiers from the Army and are called "objects" to enforce "fear".
#### II: Shopping - "She’s in her usual Martha’s dress"
#### Martha is usually the domestic servants
