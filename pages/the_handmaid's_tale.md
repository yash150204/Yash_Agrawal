## “Give me children, or else I die. Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? Behold my maid Bilhah. She shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. ”

Theocracy → A society ruled by god

Who is the person who creates this? Women. The women is actually a metaphorical representation of the womb. She is basically a womb that is going to carry humanity forward. If a women is infertile, if she cannot have children then in a despotic theocratic society she is without purpose. What is she worth? Here we come to Rachel, and there is a biblical allusion. Jacob was a prince, and was married to Rachel who is infertile. The story is Rachel not being able to make children. The maid she takes with her is a metaphor of the womb.

This is not serogacy as serogacy usually does not involve sex.

The man is religiously and socially is sanctioned to have intercourse with the womb.

Religion is a tool of massacre and is manipulated

The maid does not really have a mind of her own. She is just functioning as the symbolic womb who will bear children to the infertile women , and society approves this.

Within this epigraph, we find the idea to [[gender roles]]. What roles do women actually play? Just to continue the progeny, she must bring in the handmaid

Rachel is fighting for her position in society.
