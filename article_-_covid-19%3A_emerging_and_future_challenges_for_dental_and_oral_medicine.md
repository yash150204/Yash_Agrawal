## COVID-19: A **causative agent** (biological pathogen that causes a disease)
## Due to the characteristics of dental settings, the risk of cross
infection may be high between dental practitioners and patients.
## **What is COVID-19?**
## **Viral Etiology**
#### SARSCoV-2 is zoonotic, with Chinese horseshoe bats (_Rhinolophus sinicus_)
##### Zoonotic: When a pathogen which can cross a species barrier. This is also discussed in chapter 11 Biology.
## **Epidemiological Characteristics**
#### Started with a single animal-to-human transmission follwed by sustained human-to-human spread.
#### Interpersonal transmission through (1) respiratory droplets (2) ^^faecal-oral transmission^^.
##### Particular route of transmission in fecal particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person.
##### Cuases: poor hygine + If soil or water bodies are polluted with fecal material humans can be infected with waterbone or soil-transmitted diseases
#### Aerosol transmission is not confirmed. But it does occur and for 3 hours.
##### Aerosol: a substance enclosed under pressure and released as a fine spray by the means of a propellent gas.
#### Control is difficult as it is symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are carriers of the pathogen.
#### Fatality rate: 0.39 to 4.05% -> higher then SARS and MERS but lower then seasonal influenza
## Clinical manifestations
### Severe cases represent only 15-23% of all cases
