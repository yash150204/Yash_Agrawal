## **Trial 1 results** (failed)
|Oil|Fresh/ml|Used/ml|

|Sesemea|24.4|25.5|
|Sunflower|25|22.7|
|Coconut|37.7|31.5|
|Musturd|44|24.3|
## **Why we can't use the pH meter and magnetic stirrer method**
### Oil will cover the surface of pH meter, and then the pH meter will not be able to detect the change in H $^+$ ions.
## **Procedure**
### A 250ml conical flask is washed with distilled water
### Once the conical flask is dry, the conical flask was placed on a balance and then zeroed
### 5g of oil pored into the coical flask
### 5ml of ethanol was added into the conical flask using a syringe
### 25ml of NaOH was added to the conical flask
### A rubber plug was used to cover the conical flask
### The conical flask was placed in a water bath, where the water was at a temperature of 65 to 70ÂºC for 1 hour
### The rubber plug was removed every 15 minutes to maintain pressure
### In a burette HCl was poured till the $$0cm^3$$ mark
### After 1 hour had elapsed, 5 drops of phenolphthalein was added to the conical flask
### The conical flask was swirlled, giving the solution a pink colour
### Titration was carried out, HCl was added to the conical flask
### The titration values were noted
