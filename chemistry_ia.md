|Oil|Fresh/ml|Used/ml|

|Sunflower|25|22.7|
|Coconut|37.7|31.5|
|Musturd|44|24.3|
## **Why we can't use the pH meter and magnetic stirrer method**
### Oil will cover the surface of pH meter, and then the pH meter will not be able to detect the change in H $^+$ ions.
## **Procedure**
### Dry conical flask
### 5g of oil pored
### 5ml of ethanol
### 25ml of NaOH
### Rubber plug
### Put in water bath at a temperature from 65 - 70ÂºC
### Remove the plug every 15 minutes to release gas and maintain pressure
### Fill HCl in the burette till it reaches the $$0cm^3$$ mark
### Add 5 drops of phenolphthalein
### Add HCl into the conical flask until the color of the solution turn colorless
