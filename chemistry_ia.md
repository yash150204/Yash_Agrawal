|Oil|Fresh/ml|Used/ml|

|Sesemea|24.4|25.5|
|Sunflower|25|22.7|

|Musturd|44|24.3|
## **Why we can't use the pH meter and magnetic stirrer method**
### Oil will cover the surface of pH meter, and then the pH meter will not be able to detect the change in H $^+$ ions.
## **Procedure**
### Dry conical flask
### 5g of oil pored
### 5ml of ethanol
### 25ml of NaOH
### Put in water bath at a temperature from 65 - 70ÂºC
