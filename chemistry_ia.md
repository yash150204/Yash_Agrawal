## **Trial 1 results** (failed)
|Oil|Fresh/ml|Used/ml|
|---|---|---|
|Sesemea|24.4|25.5|
|Sunflower|25|22.7|
|Coconut|37.7|31.5|
|Musturd|44|24.3|
## **Why we can't use the pH meter and magnetic stirrer method**
### Oil will cover the surface of pH meter, and then the pH meter will not be able to detect the change in H $^+$ ions.

## **Apparatus and Chemicals**
### NaOH pellets
### I molar NaOH (8×25ml per trial)
### 1 Molar HCl
### Phenolphthalein
### Conical flask (×8) per trial
### Balance (×1)
### 5ml syringe (×1)
### Rubber plugs (×8 per trial)
### Stopwatch (×1)
### Water bath (×1)
### Thermometer (×1)
### Burette stand (×1)
### Burette (×1)
## **Procedure**
### 800ml of 1 molar NaOH was created
#### 32g of NaOH pelletes were measured on a dry butter paper on a balance
##### $$\frac{40×800}{1000}=32g$$
#### Using a funnel, the NaOH pellets were added to 800 ml of water (measured using a measuring cylinder) in a volumetric flask to prepare 800ml of 1 molar NaOH solution
### A 250ml conical flask is washed with distilled water
### Once the conical flask is dry, the conical flask was placed on a balance and then zeroed
### 5g of fresh coconut oil pored into the conical flask
### 5ml of ethanol was added into the conical flask using a syringe
### 25ml of 1 molar NaOH was added to the conical flask
### A rubber plug was used to cover the conical flask
### The conical flask was placed in a water bath, where the water was at a temperature of 65 to 70ºC for 1 hour
### The rubber plug was removed every 15 minutes to maintain pressure
### In a burette 1 molar HCl was poured till the $$0cm^3$$ mark
### After 1 hour had elapsed, 5 drops of phenolphthalein was added to the conical flask
### The conical flask was swirlled, giving the solution a pink colour
### Titration was carried out, HCl was added to the conical flask
### The titration values were noted
### From steps 2, the procedure was repeated for used coconut, fresh and used sesame oil, fresh and used mustard oil and fresh and used sunflower oil
