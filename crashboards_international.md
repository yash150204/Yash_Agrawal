## Details
### A pitch studio is a concept that we created and it’s very successful for us, it is basically a simple way for entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to us without any pressure. The reason why is because all great ideas should be pursued, and money should not be a problem. We bet that we can build a great relationship with you thus, increase our value over time.
### We will evaluate the idea and yourself based on three simple things: feasibility and potential for the idea and your eagerness to start your project and become an entrepreneur. Once done we will propose either our Full Assistance plan, our Startup Assistance plan or our Partial Assistance plan. Full Assistance is our best plan and is 5 to 6 times less expensive than market cost, Startup Assistance is 3 to 4 times less expensive than market cost, and Partial Assistance is twice less expensive than market cost.
### For the idea, feasibility means that your project can be enabled by technology or optimized by technology, potential means that your project must be scalable and become big. When it comes to you, we want to help people who really want to start an entrepreneurial project thus once we make you an offer today you will need to accept or decline it today. We have options to help you if you’re on a really tight budget such as financing options or a simple one-time fee product to start that we call an MVP-A.
