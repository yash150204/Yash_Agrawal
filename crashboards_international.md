## Event on [[Aug 4th, 2020]]
## Details
### A pitch studio is a concept that we created and it’s very successful for us, it is basically a simple way for entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to us without any pressure. The reason why is because all great ideas should be pursued, and money should not be a problem. We bet that we can build a great relationship with you thus, increase our value over time.
### We will evaluate the idea and yourself based on three simple things: feasibility and potential for the idea and your eagerness to start your project and become an entrepreneur. Once done we will propose either our Full Assistance plan, our Startup Assistance plan or our Partial Assistance plan. Full Assistance is our best plan and is 5 to 6 times less expensive than market cost, Startup Assistance is 3 to 4 times less expensive than market cost, and Partial Assistance is twice less expensive than market cost.
### For the idea, feasibility means that your project can be enabled by technology or optimized by technology, potential means that your project must be scalable and become big. When it comes to you, we want to help people who really want to start an entrepreneurial project thus once we make you an offer today you will need to accept or decline it today. We have options to help you if you’re on a really tight budget such as financing options or a simple one-time fee product to start that we call an MVP-A.
## **Who are we?**
### We are a group of students studying in an international school and have been experimenting with several business ideas since the best part of one year.
### Why starting?

#### We have experimented with several failed idea's, mostly lavish concepts on paper, but we have for the first come up with a concept that (1) helps the society and (2) is actually possible in reality along with a pretty decent profit margin.
#### One of our co-founders [[Yash Agrawal]] had signed up for an online tutoring service, and there he realised the value individuals can gets from high quality peer-peer learning + having a support network that is comprised of students in themselfs. (Expanded on the ((5f24d242-8660-40e0-96c0-466b23e10fdb)) section)
#### **In our own personal circles we wanted to break the notion that social business, build on the noble foundation of helping society cannot be profitable**
#### The basic idea of CrashBoards International is to provide (1) pocket-friendly (2) short-duration intense crash courses powered by students and ex-students themselves. What are the benefits? (1) Actual students have greater connect and knowledge of the course and subject they are teaching as they are the ones who have given the exam. No teacher can match that level of intimacy that a student experiences with an exam. (2) During the tutoring experience of Yash Agrawal, he had experienced that teaching is more than just a service. It involves more contribution (physical, mental and in terms of time), and once rewarded for this contribution, there is a lot of incentive, purpose and will to teach, serve and contribute to the society.
### In short, the vision and goal is for CrashBoards International to work towards two potent targets: (1) beneficial, impactful and sustainable peer-to-peer learning and, (2) providing a source of income to students.
## **What do we offer**
### CrashBoards’ business structure offers a paid service for SG$20 - 40 per day, per student.  Modelled around efficiency and flexibility as we teach the entire breadth of more than 13 subjects syllabus across two internationally recognised boards, the IGCSE (International general certificate for secondary education) and the IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme). With a 10% commission from tutors, 90% of the revenue will be given to our tutors as 'reward' for their services. Our sessions would occur virtually during the months of June and December, aimed at students giving their board exams in the next 5-6 months.
### The IGCSE branch of CrashBoards is inventively named CrashIGCSE, and the IBDP branch of CrashBoards will be CrashBacculureate.
### If you are familiar with the IBDP, there are several facets of the diploma, such as the individual assessment and extended essay which we plan to offer aid on.
### Our business model will facilitate the online collaboration of tutors and students who require a quick revision or guidance to boost their scores in a short span of time during their summer or winter breaks. CrashBoards believes that online teaching is highly effective and it particularly focuses on enhancing students' learning ability and critical thinking process.
### Duration?
#### At CrashBoards we understand that every teacher has his/her own style of educating, and it would be waste of talent to push an educator to complete his/her teaching in a set time frame. Keeping respect of this very fact, the duration of each subject within a course will vary, and will depend on the tutor.
#### The tutor will have to consolidate all the high scoring, tough and conceptual topics to 3 hours a day for a duration of 16 to 22 days, or maximum 30 days.   We belief that 3 hours everyday expect for a Sunday, with a 10 minute break at the mid point is extremely manageable for both students and educators.
## **Whom do we hire?**

### To minimise the cost paid by our students, keep our virtual doors open to all, and to keep CrashBoards International pocket friendly, we need to manage our workforce, i.e, our tutors. Smartly choosing our groups of tutors, we manage to keep our costs very low.
### We intend to provide job opportunities for senior high school, undergraduate and postgraduate students who will be working part time in our organisation
### In general, we are mainly to target a group of individuals who have passed through the course and are **not** pursuing professional teaching.
## Before we move on the pricing, do have a look at our consolidated SWOT analysis.
## **Timeline + pricing**
### Each branch of CrashBoards International will have its own website. The reason being to disperse the various options we are giving the consumer.
### The websites mark the commence of this venture and we are planning to do so at the start of October. Student and tutor registrations also begin around that time. The actual tutoring session for December will commence on 10th December 2020.
### More details on our timeline and pricing is one the slide right now.
### Our expected baseline revenue is SGD5,000 in our first years of operations, and that too without any initial investment!
### The broad cost for registering with us ranges from SGD320 onwards,
## **What do we want form you?**
### Our business in its entirety is optimised and enabled by technology. For all. the facets of CrashBoards, we need websites, and we really need them fast for which we have approached you.
## **Marketing + Future?**
### Marketing will be done via social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) and via a podcast we will be launching soon titles CrashTalks
### As suggested by our philosophy, "the one-shot academia to charge your brain and change your grades", we wish to pursue research in the future, while teaching other national and international courses and also offering crash-courses on entry-level exams and admissions.s
