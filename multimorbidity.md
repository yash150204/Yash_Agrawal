## https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/morbidity-comorbidity-and-multimorbidity-what-do-they-mean
## **Morbity**, which broadly refers to 'illness' or 'diseases'.
## This is a term used in clinical practice and in health policy documents.
## Comorbidity simply means more than one illness or disease occurring in one person at the same time and multimorbidity means more than two illnesses or diseases occurring in the same person at the same time.
## This statement prompted a question, "**is there a difference between illness and diseases?**
#### Illness is something that needs to be managed such as feelings of pain, discomfort, distress, weakness, fatigue, etc. Disease is something that needs to be cured. Obviously, these two things are not mutually exclusive, and they often occur together.

## These problems include physical conditions such as heart problem, diabetes and vision problem, and mental health such as depression.
## Studies indicate that multimorbity is related to the individualsâ€™ age and socioeconomic conditions, that is, elderly people with worse economic and living conditions tend to be the most affected
