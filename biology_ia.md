## **Apparatus**
### YPD broth ( $$5g×6$$ per trial)
### _S. cerevisiae_  ( $$5g×6$$ per trial)
### PPA
### Balance (×1)
### Butter paper (×1)
### Measuring cylinder* (×1)
### Beaker* (×6 for_S. cerevisiae_  )
### Beaker (×5 for PPA)
### Glass rod (×2)
### 250ml Conical flasks* (×6)
### 10ml syringe (×6)
## **Procedure**
### $$5g×6$$ of YPD broth was taken on a butter paper (measured using a balance) added to 600ml of water (measured using a measuring cylinder) and mixed with a glass rod until a clear yellow solution is formed
### $$5g×6$$ of _S. cerevisiae_ are taken in 6 beakers which have water heated to 40ºC
#### The temperature is to activate _S. cerevisiae_
### The _S. cerevisiae_  solution was mixed using a glass rod until a milky solution was formed
### 0.2g of pure PPA was taken in 100ml of water to make a 0.1g/100ml PPA solution
#### This process was repeated with 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 g of PPA
### Using a syringe, 10ml each concentration of PPA was poured into 5 250ml conical flasks
### Using a syringe, 10ml of water was poured into 1 conical flask
### 100ml of YPD broth was poured into each of the 6 conical flasks
### 100ml of the _S. cerevisiae_ solution was each added into the conical flask
### 
### Make final solution
### Analysis
